             Welcome to The Local Geekery's webpage! Located just outside of Schomberg, The Local Geekery is a small lunch café catering to
        geeks of all fandoms.
        <br />
        <br />
             With a casual, relaxed environment, you'll feel right at home discussing the latest episode of your favorite TV with your friends,
        or bunkering down on your own, novel in hand.
        <br />
        <br />
             Menu items are limited and cycle regularly. If you don't see something from your fandom this month, you can check back next month.
        We also take suggestions if you have an idea of geeky eat or drink you'd like us to attempt!
        <br />
